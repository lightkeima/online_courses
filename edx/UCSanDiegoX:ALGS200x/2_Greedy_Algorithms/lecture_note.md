## Safe Choice

A greedy choice is called safe choice if there is an optimal solution consistent this first choice

## Celebration Party Problem

Assume x1 <= x2 <= x3 <= .. <= xn

PointsCoverSorted
```
segments <- empty list
while left <=n:
	(l,r) <- (Xleft, Xleft + 2)
	segments.append((l,r))
	left <- left + 1
	whilt left <= n and xleft <= r:
	left <- left + 1
return segments
```
